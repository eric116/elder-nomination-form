            <h2>Character Qualifications</h2>
            The Bible doesn’t offer a detailed list of traits for every role within the Body, but it is far from silent on the subject of elders. In multiple passages of Scripture, a portrait emerges as to the type of Christian who should be selected for this important role. Elders are to:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Be mature believers</b> “He must not be a recent convert, or he may become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil.” – I Timothy 3:6</li>
                <li><b>Be committed to guiding their family</b> “An elder must manage his own household well, with all dignity keeping his children submissive. For if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God’s church?” – I Timothy 3:4-5</li>
                <li><b>Be able to receive Biblical instruction and teach others</b> “He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine.” – Titus 1:9</li>
                <li><b>Be humble and submissive to God’s will for their lives and the church</b> “He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined.” – Titus 1:7</li>
                <li><b>Have a good reputation inside and outside of the church</b> “An overseer must be above reproach...He must be well thought of by outsiders, so that he may not fall into disgrace, into a snare of the devil.” – I Timothy 3:2, 7 (NASB)</li>
                <li><b>Be generous towards God’s work with their time, talent, and tithe</b> “For the overseer must be above reproach as God’s steward” – Titus 1:7 (NASB)</li>
            </ul>
